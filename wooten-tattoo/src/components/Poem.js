                    Who makes these changes?<br />
                    I shoot an arrow right.<br />

                    I ride after a deer and I find myself<br />
                    chased by a hog.

                    I plot to get what I want<br />
                    and end up in prison.

                    I dig pits to trap others<br />
                    and fall in.

                    I should be suspicious<br />
                    of what I want.
